# Webcam Security System - Todo & Goals

## üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY: Recording System Reliability Fixes

**Status:** Recording system has critical failures that prevent reliable security footage capture.
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Current system unsuitable for production use
**Overall Reliability Score:** 4.2/10 (POOR)

### Critical Issues Identified (2025-09-30 Code Audit)
- ‚ùå Recording channel frames are discarded (100% data loss from recordChannel)
- ‚ùå No disk space checks before recording
- ‚ùå Race conditions in recording state management
- ‚ùå Buffer overflow causes silent frame drops (up to 6.7 seconds lost)
- ‚ùå No frame write verification (silent data corruption)
- ‚ùå Zero redundancy mechanisms

### Architecture Change: Recording Must Be Independent of WebRTC

**Current (Broken):** Recording depends on WebRTC track handlers ‚Üí fragile, network-dependent
**Target:** Recording directly from FrameDistributor ‚Üí robust, network-independent

```
Camera ‚Üí FrameDistributor ‚Üí recordChannel ‚Üí VP9 Encoder ‚Üí WebM (Direct to disk)
                          ‚Üí vp9Channel ‚Üí WebRTC (Live streaming only)
                          ‚Üí motionChannel ‚Üí Motion Detection
```
