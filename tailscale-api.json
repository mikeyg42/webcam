    "description": "### Overview\n\n**The API endpoints documented here are stable. However, the OpenAPI spec used to generate this documentation is unstable. It may change or break without notice.**\n\nThe Tailscale API is a (mostly) RESTful API. Typically, both POST bodies and responses are JSON-encoded.\n\n### Base URL\n\nThe base URL for the Tailscale API is https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/.\n\nExamples in this document may abbreviate this to `/api/v2/`.\n\n### Authentication\n\nRequests to the Tailscale API are authenticated with an API access token (sometimes called an API key).\nAccess tokens can be supplied as the username portion of HTTP Basic authentication\n(leave the password blank) or as an OAuth Bearer token:\n\n```\n// passing token with basic auth\ncurl -u \"tskey-api-xxxxx:\" https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/...\n\n// passing token as bearer token\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer tskey-api-xxxxx\" https://api.tailscale.com/api/v2/...\n```\n\nAccess tokens for individual users can be created and managed from the [Keys](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys) page of the admin console. These tokens will have the same permissions as the owning user, and can be set to expire in 1 to 90 days. Access tokens are identifiable by the prefix tskey-api-.\n\nAlternatively, an OAuth client can be used to create short-lived access tokens with scoped permission. OAuth clients don't expire, and can therefore be used to provide ongoing access to the API, creating access tokens as needed. OAuth clients and the access tokens they create are not tied to an individual Tailscale user. OAuth client secrets are identifiable by the prefix tskey-client-. Learn more about [OAuth clients].\n\n[ OAuth clients ]: https://tailscale.com/kb/1215/\n\n### Errors\n\nThe Tailscale API returns status codes consistent with standard HTTP conventions. In addition to the status code, errors may include additional information in the response body:\n\n```\n{\n  \"message\": \"additional error information\"\n}\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\nThe Tailscale API does not currently support pagination. All results are returned at once.",
